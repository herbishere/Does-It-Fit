# Will I Sleep This Semester - An OSU PostBacc CS Schedule Calculator

## Inspiration
The [OSU Course Explorer](https://osu-cs-course-explorer.com/) is a wonderful tool for getting the opinion of other students regarding the difficulty and time-commitment required for various courses. Despite that, lots of students still go on the slack and the subreddit to ask the question: Should I take theses classes together? With a desire to learn Python and a willingness to be challenged, we stepped up to solve this problem.

## What it does
This program first imports and extracts relevant data from OSU course explorer's spreadsheet. Using the extracted data, it then calculates various statistics from the data. The user than shares aspects of their schedule and the program informs them whether or not their schedule is appropriate based on available time and difficulty of courses.

## How we built it
Language: Python

Tools:
- PySimpleGUI for the GUI
- PyInstaller for making the executable

## Challenges we ran into
- As individuals who have mainly done projects in C++, learning Python was an interesting challenge.
- Different schedules made coordinating the design of the project was difficult
- Working in different environments (Mac and Windows) led to some comptability problems

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We were able to accomplish the project without any previous knowledge on how to use Python

## What we learned
- Python is quite different than C++
- How to implement a GUI
- How to make a program into an executable

## What's next for WISTS
- Improve UI design
- Improve calculations by performing proper Data Analysis
- Remake into Web App
- Update data set to include future classes and scores/remove classes no longer taught
- Expand app to analyze datasets from other Universities
- Improve storage algorithms
- Implement course compatibility flags

## To Run
On Terminal Use Python 3 To Run main.py
i.e. "python3 main.py" or "python main.py"

NOTE: GUI only tested on Windows
