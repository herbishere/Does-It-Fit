If you are having trouble, you really need to start them early as lots of people struggle right up to the end - but you never see many people asking questions earlier in the week.

The first exam probably differs a lot from what people expect from a computer science exam, and a lot of people did poorly (learn how to trace code, learn the unusual cases and what type of errors there are).  Actually messing with the errors the and warnings the book gives might be good practice. The second exam is a bit more conventional.

The professor's communication is decent, but he neglects to fully answer questions sometimes, and frequently revises assignment requirements halfway through (again, get started early).  He is also very inflexible considering this is a course partly aimed at people pursuing a second career.

The book is decent, but has lots of errors.  The course notes are helpful, but also have errors.  The video lectures were practically unwatchable to me (accent, voice, pacing).

Wolford doesn't tell you any of this early on and it royally screwed me as the term went on. Lots of long nights.

One issue is that some of the requirements aren't always clear. Once again, TA's are lenient. I turned in one assignment where I didn't meet the requirements, (misinterpreted what Wolford wanted), and the TA let me turn in the assignment again after he had graded it when I brought up my concerns.

This class was easy and as others say the textbook is phenomenal. Don't get too cocky for the exams because they are very detail oriented.

",Winter 2017,Yes,CS 225 - Discrete Structures in Computer Science,3,13-18 hours,"I had a very interesting relationship with this class. Sometimes I loved it, other times I hated it. Looking back, I really do enjoy the material. I didn't find that this class get harder/easier after a certain point in the course - I think it remained at the same level of difficulty for the most part. I read somewhere that induction is the hardest part of the course, but unfortunately that was not the case for me and many others in the class. Permutation and combinations were very challenging (2nd to last week).

You'll find that most weeks are challenging since everything is new stuff but then you look back and study for the midterm/final and you're a pro at all the stuff before. Induction becomes fairly simple after a few weeks of letting it sit in your head, so don't sweat it if it's taking you a while to grasp it immediately. 

Regarding the lectures, for some weeks they were good and others they weren't. I found them more useful in the beginning , very weak during the middle, and better the last weeks. You'd think the practice problems they go over in the lectures would help you in the HW but for most weeks they don't. Apparently the lectures were made while they were using another textbook. Be prepared to watch youtube videos - plenty of great content on there. TrevTutor was especially helpful for me. ",No,,,,
3/26/2017 15:39:45,CS 373 - Defense Against the Dark Arts,1,6-12 hours,"-The course consists mainly of weekly writeups (in the form of blog posts) of the previous weeks materials (week 3 writeup is on week 2 material). The 1st assignment was like a proper lab submission and there was a single graded discussion post and then we just did writeups for the rest of the term. Basically each week there is about 1-2 labs worth of work to complete and then you make a blog post about what you did, what you learned, anything interesting you found and submit a URL to that post. Yeah, that is pretty vague instructions but that's the nature of this class. I would do a writeup of the portion of the lab(s) that I was able to complete for that week and include a bunch of screenshots and commands I used. Sometimes I was not able to get through all of the labs but I still received full credit on my writeups. The Final consisted of recording a ~30 min presentation on a cybersecurity issue of your choice.
-You get as much out of this class as you want. The professor is a ghost. If you are interested in CyberSecurity you have the opportunity to learn a lot, sort of an intro to many different areas of cybersecurity. If you don't give a shit, you can half-ass the writeups and still do fine. I thought the lectures were very interesting and different from the usual OSU format. They were all guest lecturers, different security professionals, most of whom worked at Intel Security and the videos are of the actual lectures given on campus. As a result, there is quite a lot of lecture video each week (about 1-2 hours) where they discuss the materials as well as go over the labs. I only thought the last one on Mobile Security kinda sucked, the rest I enjoyed. If you are interested in the material, and not OCD anal retentive when it comes to instructions or prompt grading (we received grades only 3 times the whole quarter, in week 8 covering weeks 1-7, week 10 covering weeks 7-9, and the final grade), I think you will enjoy this class because it is a class where you can learn a lot AND that is low stress at the same time. I think that is rare in this program. 
-McGrath is sometimes not clear with his instructions and is stubborn. Ask for clarification on the forums if you don't understand something. Some students may be tempted to offer reasonable suggestions for improvements (such as using a single place to post all course information rather than multiple websites or posting all TEACH submission links at the start of the term). He will not listen to you. Regardless, there is NO POINT in being argumentative with him on Piazza. This class is very easy and all you are doing is poking a sleeping bear. 
-TopHat is the ""textbook"" for this class. It's basically the equivalent of Canvas where videos and assignment due dates are posted. He will not allow students to download the videos. There is no point in paying for the year long access because you won't have access to the Virtual Machines so just choose the cheapest option which was the quarter long access for $60.

It doesn't hurt to read the project/lab specs for the week before doing any reading to understand what you'll need to learn. That's half the battle really. We didn't use copy constructors or operator overloading yet it takes up like 50 pages of chapter 11 which is the roughest chapter.

I studied for the midterm and final using anki flashcards. I'd pull all of the questions from the summaries/quizzes/end of section textbook review questions and put them in to a flashcard app. This helped me get an A on both major tests.

The extra credit options for the projects are worth taking. They get harder as the semester moves forward so try to do as much as possible in the beginning of the semesters in order to give yourself a buffer for the midterm and final (worth a combined 40% of your grade).

8/22/2018 19:49:04,CS 261 - Data Structures,2,6-12 hours,"The first few weeks of this class are fairly straightforward, covering things like dynamic arrays and linked lists. On top of these you implement interfaces like bags, stacks and queues. The latter part of the course becomes more challenging conceptually, covering trees (BST, AVL, heaps), hash maps/tables, and graphs(BFS, DFS, Dijkstra). Exams have a lot of questions revolving around time complexity (e.g. whats the average case for adding to a linked list, what about a hash map with chaining, with buckets?). They also have a few programming questions for which you can use a text editor (offline), and of course application questions like simulate breadth and depth first searches of this graph or remove the value 16 from this BST.

The assignments required us to implement the interface as specified in the header (.H) like add, contains, removeAt, etc. You do not need a strong understanding of headers, OOP, makefiles, etc. as the focus is on the data structures themselves. Some assignments will build on these data structures (we built a spell checker on top of a hash table with buckets).

Most weeks you will have group work covering 3-5 worksheets (taking 1-3 hours to complete in one go), and an assignment. The worksheets require the group to work on implementation of the same basic functions you will implement in the assignments. They are worth basically nothing in the grand scheme of things at 1 mark each for participation. That said, understanding the worksheets will help you succeed in both the assignments and exams for this class.

The lectures are basically visual versions of the textbook readings. I found myself reading the chapters less and less as the semester wore on. Most of the content in the readings are covered in the videos, with the longest being around 30 mins and the shortest around 10 min. Make liberal use of the 1.5x speed to get through some of the repetitive or drier sections. In addition, Mycodeschool on youtube does excellent comprehensive lectures about most of the data structures covered in this class.

For me the most difficult part was rebalancing AVL trees (although we didn't implement it). Conversely, the easiest part was hashmaps/tables (since these are basically identical to the first weeks coverage of dynamic arrays and linked lists).  The best advice I can give for this class is to understand the abstract data types (ADTs) conceptually along with their interfaces.

It seems partners were optional before, but were mandatory this term. Thankfully we were able to choose our partners.

The Bad:  The professor begins by stating that this is a ""get out what you put in class"" and that is BS.  That's the excuse the professor uses to justify getting full pay for ""teaching"" a class in which I doubt he spends more than 15 minutes a week on.

The course is theoretically supposed to help you develop the skills needed for Databases(CS340) but it is presented very poorly.The lecture content was pretty awful.  The lectures are given as if everyone is already familiar with the topics and just needs a refresh on material. You'll find that a large amount of the class does have Web Dev experience and will rate the class as easy but do not be lulled into a false sense of security if this is your first time with Web Dev. 

This course was my first experience with Web Dev and it was one of the hardest  
classes I've taken. I would rate it harder than 325 because of the lack of quality reference material. I took this course over the summer along with data structs and found myself spending about twice as much time on 290 than 261. The asynchronous requests on the last project were brutal and I went to office hours multiple times to try to get my code working but the TAs would just alter the code for you and not really explain anything. 
Final thoughts: If you are concerned about this course I would strongly recommend Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp Course on Udemy. In total it has about 45 hours of lecture and covers almost every topic from 290 in much better detail.

If you want to prep before starting class, get Visual Studio up and running with the Irvine library via the instructions from the Irvine book's website. This can be time consuming if you aren't used to Windows or Visual Studio.",No,,,,

Reusable code is your friend (menu/input validation). The front half of the class is an uphill slog, it does get better but be prepared to code, a lot. If you can take this course alone, do so, especially if you are working. If you need to take another class try and take one with a lighter work load.",SP 2019,No,,,,,,,,,
6/13/2019 17:35:33,CS 344 - Operating Systems,2,6-12 hours,"Watch the lectures, then read the assignment requirements and start thinking about them. Plan your program, then write it, then read over the reqs AGAIN to make sure you got them all. The requirements are long, but they are clear and precise. Three of the four programs even have grading scripts. The majority of your time will likely be spent debugging, so **get started early!** I think the first bash assignment was the hardest, and the 3 others were all C and not too bad at all. The small python program takes all of 10min to write, even if you do not know python. The TAs are awesome and make themselves freely available on the Slack, so use that if you need it.",SP2019,Yes,CS 361 - Software Engineering I,2,0-5 hours,"This class will likely be miserable for anyone. There is such a low chance that the stars align and you are matched with a motivated and capable group that just cruises through the assignments. And the assignments themselves do not even take long, except for coordinating with 4 other people plus a customer. It is almost guaranteed that you will be stuck with AT LEAST one person who does not care to contribute anything worthwhile. The instructor thrives on ambiguity, and instructs his TAs to take off petty points for not meeting some imagined requirements that were never shared with the students. It's quite an interesting concept for a class that is all about gathering requirements. When questioning about such deductions, prepare to see deflection like you've never seen. I really have yet to figure out why a class setup like this is necessary for post bac students, most of which are aware of what the 'real world' work force is like. Thank you for wasting my $2000 and my time.",Yes,CS 475 - Intro to Parallel Programming,2,0-5 hours,"This class is great, I would recommend it to anyone. The instructor does his best to fit a good amount of information in the short term. The listed pre-req is CS325 (algos), but if you've taken CS261, you should be fine. I thought having CS271 done was more helpful than either of those though. This term, the class had 8 projects, weekly quizzes and two exams (midterm and final). Grading is not harsh, but you do need a 96-97% or so for an A. The (unofficial) Slack group was really helpful, and the instructor is also very helpful and responsive."
6/19/2019 5:09:55,CS 225 - Discrete Structures in Computer Science,2,6-12 hours,"This class, as taught by Ehsan, is not bad. You might not come away from it being a discrete maths genius (it is a very lite survey over the topics with no deep dives into them), but as a class it's not a tough one to get through. 

The content in this class can be obtuse in spots, but as others have mentioned after the midterm things get easier. As a person that isn't a mathy in any way at all I managed to do ok by simply brute forcing the information. Continuously go over the answers provided to you for assigned HW questions and quizzes, as those are the types you will see on the exams. Familiarity with the subject matter makes everything easier. Also, using chegg/slader to check your answers and see how problems are worked out is very helpful as well.  And you might even find that these concepts start to make sense to you after a while.",SP 2019,No,,,,,,,,,
6/20/2019 16:23:52,CS 162 - Intro to Computer Science II,4,18+ hours,"Start all projects as early as possible - you will be thankful you did because you'll need the time to debug and test your projects. The quizzes are more or less helpful, so don't stress too much about them. There is a huge knowledge jump from 161 to 162 (though I don't know how this will change as the courses switch to Python).
